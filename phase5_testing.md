### Planning the Test
- Develop multiple beta versions for user comparison.
- Use a "Show, Don’t Tell" approach, letting users explore the app with minimal guidance.
- Collect observations and feedback unobtrusively.

### Interaction and Observation
- Beta versions mimic the original app’s environment.
- Use questionnaires to gather insights, such as:
  - How effective was the service?
  - What changes would you suggest?

### Observation Goals
- Note user mistakes or misinterpretations.
- Ask clarifying questions like:
  - What was the best/worst feature of the app?
  - How does it compare to other apps?

## Outcomes and Refinements

### Key Findings
- Improve UI/UX design for smoother interactions.
- Modify the cart feature for better synchronization across devices.
- Address delivery charges based on distance to optimize costs.

### Viability, Feasibility, and Desirability
- **Desirability:** High demand for online pharmacy services during COVID and for the elderly or busy professionals.
- **Feasibility:** App runs on standard smartphones with minimal storage requirements.
- **Viability:** Ensure the app is self-sustaining and aligns with long-term business goals.
