# Phase 2: Define

This phase explores the **Define** stage of our Pharmtech app, following the **Empathize** phase. It focuses on analyzing user insights, crafting actionable problem statements, and addressing user needs effectively.

## Key Features

### 1. Point of View (POV)
A framework to define meaningful and actionable problem statements by combining:
- **User:** Who are we designing for?
- **Need:** What do they require?
- **Insight:** Why is this important?

### 2. How Might We (HMW)
Reframe challenges into opportunities by asking questions like:
- How might we make the product more user-friendly?  
- How might we leverage technology to enhance user experiences?

### 3. Why-How Ladder
An interview-based technique to identify:
- **Why** a problem matters (higher abstraction).  
- **How** solutions can be implemented (lower abstraction).

### 4. Powers of Ten
